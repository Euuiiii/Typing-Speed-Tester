    "text": "The quantum entanglement of subatomic particles continues to baffle physicists worldwide. When two particles become entangled, their quantum states become correlated, regardless of the distance between them. This means that measuring one particle instantly affects its partner, even if they're light-years apart. The implications of this phenomenon are profound, challenging our understanding of space, time, and causality.",

Each neuron, a microscopic computational unit, forms thousands of connections with its neighbors, creating an unfathomably dense web of information processing. When we experience consciousness, billions of these neurons fire in precise patterns, their electrical impulses traveling at speeds up to 268 miles per hour.",

Public-key cryptography uses pairs of keys for encryption and decryption, where the public key can be freely distributed while the private key remains secret. Hash functions create fixed-length outputs from variable-length inputs, with the property that it's computationally infeasible to find two inputs that produce the same output.",
